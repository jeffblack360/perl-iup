 $dial = IUP::Dial->new( ORIENTATION=>"VERTICAL" );

=item B<DENSITY>

Number of lines per pixel in the handle of the dial.
Default is "0.2".

=item L<EXPAND|[%m.at%]/EXPAND>

The default is "NO".

=item L<FGCOLOR|[%m.at%]/FGCOLOR>

Foreground color. The default
value is "64 64 64". Not used for the circular dial.

=item L<SIZE|[%m.at%]/SIZE>

I<(non inheritable)>

The initial size is "16x80", "80x16" or "40x35" according to the dial orientation. Set to
C<undef> to allow the automatic layout use smaller values.

=item B<ORIENTATION>

I<(creation only) (non inheritable)>

Dial layout configuration "VERTICAL", "HORIZONTAL" or "CIRCULAR". Default:
"HORIZONTAL".

=item B<UNIT>

Unit of the angle. Can be "DEGREES" or "RADIANS". Default is
"RADIANS". Used only in the callbacks.

=item B<VALUE>

I<(non inheritable)>

The dial angular value in radians. The
value is reset to zero when the interaction is started, except for
C<ORIENTATION="CIRCULAR">. When orientation is vertical or horizontal, the
dial measures relative angles. When orientation is circular the dial
measure absolute angles, where the origin is at 3 o'clock.

=item B<BUTTON_PRESS_CB>

Called when the user presses the left mouse button
over the dial. The angle here is always zero, except for the circular
dial.

B<$self:> reference to the element (IUP::Dial) that activated the event

B<$angle:> the dial value converted according to UNIT.

=item B<BUTTON_RELEASE_CB>

Called when the user releases the left mouse
button after pressing it over the dial.

=item B<MOUSEMOVE_CB>

Called each time the user moves the dial with the
mouse button pressed. The angle the dial rotated since it was
initialized is passed as a parameter.

[%h.at_handler%]

 sub mousemove_cb_handler {
   my ($self, $angle) = @_;

=item B<VALUECHANGED_CB>

Called after the value was interactively changed by
the user. It is called whenever a B<BUTTON_PRESS_CB>, a
B<BUTTON_RELEASE_CB> or a B<MOUSEMOVE_CB> would also be called, but if
defined those callbacks will not be called.

[% h.notes %]

When the keyboard arrows are pressed and released the mouse press and
the mouse release callbacks are called in this order. If you hold the
key down the mouse move callback is also called for every repetition.

When the wheel is rotated only the mouse move callback is called, and
it increments the last angle the dial was rotated.

In all cases the value is incremented or decremented by PI/10 (18
degrees).

If you press Shift while using the arrow keys the increment is reduced
to PI/100 (1.8 degrees). Press the Home key in the circular dial to
reset to 0.
