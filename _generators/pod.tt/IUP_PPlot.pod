Creates a PPlot-based plot. PPlot is a library for creating plots that is system independent. 

It is available at SourceForge L<http://pplot.sourceforge.net|http://pplot.sourceforge.net/>.
However the standard PPlot distribution source code was changed for iup_pplot library 
(to improve features and visual appearance).

=head2 Guide

Each plot can contain 2 B<axis> (X and Y), a B<title>, a B<legend>
B<box>, a B<grid>, a B<dataset> B<area> and as many B<datasets> you
want.

Each data set is added using the L<IUP::PPlotAdd |IUP::PPlotAdd> function. All other plot
parameters are configured by attributes.

If no attribute is set, the default values were selected to best
display the plot.

When setting attributes the plot is NOT redrawn until the REDRAW
attribute is set or a redraw event occurs.

The B<dataset area> is delimited by a margin. Data is only plotted
inside the dataset area. Axis and main title are positioned independent
of this margin. It is very important to set the margins when using axis
automatic scaling or the axis maybe hidden.

The B<legend box> is a list of the dataset names, each one drawn with
the same color of the correspondent dataset. The box is located in one
of the four corners of the dataset area.

The B<grid> is automatically spaced accordingly the current axis
displayed values.

The B<title> is always centered in the top of the plot.

The B<axis> are always positioned at the origin, except when
CrossOrigin is disabled, then it is positioned at the left-bottom. If
values are only positive then the origin will be placed in left bottom
position. If values are negative and positive then origin will be
placed inside the plot. The ticks in the axis are also automatically
distributed.

PPlot implementation demands that the MARGIN* attributes must be set so
the plot is not cropped.

=head2 Interaction

=head2 Zoom

Zoom in can be done selecting a region using the left mouse button.
Zoom out is done with a single click of the left mouse button. If the
B<Ctrl+X> key combination is pressed the zoom selection is restricted
to the X axis, the Y axis will be left unchanged. If the B<Ctrl+Y> key
combination is pressed the zoom selection is restricted to the Y axis,
the X axis will be left unchanged. If the B<Ctrl+R> key combination is
pressed the zoom selection is restored to a free rectangle.

Each zoom in operation is stacked, so each zoom out operation goes back
the the previous zoom selection.

Zoom operates on B<AXS_XMAX, AXS_XMIN, AXS_YMAX, AXS_YMIN> even 
if B<AUTOMIN/MAX> is enabled. The axis may be hidden depending on the
selected rectangle.

=head2 CrossHair Cursor

If you press the B<Ctrl+Shift> key combination, while holding the left
mouse button down, a cross hair cursor will be displayed for each
dataset in the plot. The X coordinate will control the cursor, the Y
coordinate will reflect each dataset correspondent value.

=head2 Selection and Editing

Selection and editing of a dataset can be enabled using the B<DS_EDIT>
attribute.

To select all the samples in the dataset press the B<Shift> key while
clicking with the left mouse button near a sample in the dataset. To
deselect all samples press the B<Shift> key while clicking with the
left mouse button in the background.

To select or deselect individual samples press the B<Ctrl> key while
clicking with the left mouse button near the sample in the dataset.

After selecting samples use the B<Del> key to remove the selected
samples. Also use the arrow keys to move the Y coordinate of the
selected samples. Press the B<Ctrl> key to increase the step size when
moving the Y coordinate.

=head2 Auxiliary Functions

=head3 PlotBegin()

  $plot->PlotBegin($strXdata);
  #or
  $plot->PlotBegin();

Prepares a dataset to receive samples. If strXdata is 1 then the X axis
value is a string.

=head3 PlotAdd()

 $plot->PlotAdd($x, $y);

Adds a sample to the dataset. 

NOTE: there is an autodetection whether it calls iupPlotAddStr
or iupPlotAdd behind the scene.

=head3 PlotEnd()

 $index = $plot->PlotEnd();

Adds a 2D dataset to the plot and returns the dataset B<index>. The
data set can be empty. Redraw is NOT done until the REDRAW attribute is
set. Also it will change the current dataset index to the return value.
You can only set attributes of a dataset AFTER you added the dataset.
Can only be called if L<PlotBegin|IUP::PPlot/"PlotBegin()"> was called. Whenever you create a
dataset all its "DS_*" attributes will be set to the default values.
Notice that DS_MODE must be set before other "DS_*" attributes.

=head3 PlotInsert()

 $plot->PlotInsert($index, $sample_index, $x, $y);

Inserts a sample in a dataset at the given B<sample_index>. Can be used
only after the dataset is added to the plot (after L<PlotBegin|/"PlotBegin()">).

NOTE: there is an autodetection whether it calls iupPlotInsertStr
or iupPlotInsert behind the scene.

=head3 PlotInsertPoints()

 @values = ( $x1, $y1, $x2, $y2, $x3, $y3, $x4, $y4 );
 $plot->InsertPoints($index, $sample_index, \@values);

Inserts an array of samples in a dataset at the given B<sample_index>. (Since iup-3.4)

Can be used only after the dataset is added to the plot e.g.

  $plot->PlotBegin(0);
  $index = $mainplot->PlotEnd();
  $plot->PlotInsertPoints($index, 2, \@values); ###ZZZ-test-this(maybe add example)

NOTE: there is an autodetection whether it calls iupPlotInsertStrPoints
or iupPlotInsertPoints behind the scene.

=head3 PlotAddPoints()

 @values = ( $x1, $y1, $x2, $y2, $x3, $y3, $x4, $y4 );
 $plot->PlotAddPoints($index, \@values);

Adds an array of samples in a dataset at the end. (Since iup-3.4)

Can be used only after the dataset is added to the plot e.g.

  $plot->PlotBegin(0);
  $index = $mainplot->PlotEnd();
  $plot->PlotAddPoints($index, \@values);  

NOTE: there is an autodetection whether it calls iupPlotAddStrPoints
or iupPlotAddPoints behind the scene.

=head3 PlotTransform()

 ($ix, $iy) = $plot->PlotTransform($x, $y);

Converts coordinates in plot units to pixels. It should be used in
PREDRAW_CB and POSTDRAW_CB callbacks only. Output variables can be NULL
if not used. It can be used inside other callbacks, but make sure that
the drawing after a resize is done.

=head3 PlotPaintTo()

 $plot->PlotPaintTo($canvas);
 
Plots to the given canvas instead of the display canvas.

Handy if you want to save the plot into L<IUP::Canvas::SVG> or L<IUP::Canvas::EMF> like this:

  my $cnv = IUP::Canvas::SVG->new(filename=>"output.svg", width=>300, height=>210, resolution=>4);
  $mainplot->PlotPaintTo($cnv);
  $cnv->cdKillCanvas();
