[% h.name %]

[% n.iupclipboard %]

[% h.desc %] 

Creates an element that allows access to the clipboard. Each clipboard
should be destroyed using L<Destroy|[%m.elem%]/"Destroy()"> method, but
you can use only one for entire application because it does not store
any data inside. Or you can simply create and destroy everytime you
need to copy or paste.

Example - copy to clipboard:

 $text = IUP::Text->new();
 #...
 $clipboard = IUP::Clipboard->new();
 $clipboard->TEXT( $text->VALUE );
 $clipboard->Destroy();
 ###XXX-todo-not-tested

Example - paste from clipboard:

 $text = IUP::Text->new();
 #...
 $clipboard = IUP::Clipboard->new();
 $text->VALUE( $clipboard->TEXT );
 $clipboard->Destroy();

In GTK is a B<GdkPixbuf*>. 

In Motif is a B<Pixmap>. 

The returned handle in a paste must be released after used (GlobalFree(handle), g_object_unref(pixbuf)
or XFreePixmap(display, pixmap)). After copy, do NOT release the given
handle. See IUP-IM Functions for utility functions on image native handles. (GTK 2.6)
