Creates a menu item that, when selected, opens another menu.

=head2 Creation

 Ihandle* IupSubmenu(const char *title, Ihandle *menu); [in C]
 iup.submenu{menu: ihandle[; title = title: string]} -> (elem: ihandle) [in Lua]
 submenu(title, menu) [in LED]

B<title>: String containing the text to be shown on the item. It can be
NULL (nil in Lua), not optional in LED. It will set the TITLE
attribute.

B<menu>: optional child menu identifier. It can be NULL (nil in Lua),
not optional in LED.

Returns: the identifier of the created element, or NULL if an error
occurs.

=head2 Attributes

B<IMAGE> [Windows and GTK Only] (non inheritable): Image name of the
submenu image. In Windows, an item in a menu bar cannot have a check
mark. Ignored if submenu in a menu bar. A recommended size would be
16x16 to fit the image in the menu item. In Windows, if larger than the
check mark area it will be cropped. (since 3.0)

L<KEY|../attrib/iup_key.html> (non inheritable): Underlines a key
character in the submenu title. It is updated only when TITLE is
updated. B<Deprecated>, use the mnemonic support directly in the TITLE
attribute.

L<TITLE|../attrib/iup_title.html> (non inheritable): Submenu Text. The
"&" character can be used to define a mnemonic, the next character will
be used as key. Use "&&" to show the "&" character instead on defining
a mnemonic.

L<WID|../attrib/iup_wid.html> (non inheritable): In Windows, returns
the HMENU of the parent menu and it is actually created only when its
child menu is mapped.
