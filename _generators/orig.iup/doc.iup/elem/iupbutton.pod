=head1 IupButton

Creates an interface element that is a button. When selected, this
element activates a function in the application. Its visual
presentation can contain a text and/or an image.

=head2 Creation

 Ihandle* IupButton(const char *title, const char *action); [in C]iup.button{[title = title: string]} -> elem: ihandle [in Lua]button(title, action) [in LED]

B<title>: Text to be shown to the user. It can be NULL. It will set the
TITLE attribute.

B<action>: Name of the action generated when the button is selected. It
can be NULL.

Returns: the identifier of the created element, or NULL if an error
occurs.

=head2 Attributes

B<ALIGNMENT> (non inheritable): horizontal and vertical alignment.
Possible values: "ALEFT", "ACENTER" and "ARIGHT", combined to "ATOP",
"ACENTER" and "ABOTTOM". Default: "ACENTER:ACENTER". Partial values are
also accepted, like "ARIGHT" or ":ATOP", the other value will be used
from the current alignment. In Motif, vertical alignment is restricted
to "ACENTER". In GTK, horizontal alignment for multiple lines will
align only the text block. (since 3.0)

L<BGCOLOR|../attrib/iup_bgcolor.html>: Background color. If text and
image are not defined, the button is configured to simply show a color,
in this case set the button size because the natural size will be very
small. In Windows, the BGCOLOR attribute is ignored if text or image is
defined. Default: the global attribute DLGBGCOLOR. BGCOLOR is ignored
when FLAT=YES because it will be used the background from the native
parent.

B<CANFOCUS> (creation only) (non inheritable): enables the focus
traversal of the control. In Windows the button will respect CANFOCUS
in opposite to the other controls. Default: YES. (since 3.0)

B<FLAT> (creation only): Hides the button borders until the mouse enter
the button area. Can be YES or NO. Default: NO.

L<FGCOLOR|../attrib/iup_fgcolor.html>: Text color. Default: the global
attribute DLGFGCOLOR.

B<IMAGE> (non inheritable): Image name. If set before map defines the
behavior of the button to contain an image. The natural size will be
size of the image in pixels, plus the button borders. Use
L<IupSetHandle|../func/iupsethandle.html> or
L<IupSetAttributeHandle|../func/iupsetattributehandle.html> to
associate an image to a name. See also L<IupImage|iupimage.html>. If
TITLE is also defined and not empty both will be shown (except in
Motif). (GTK 2.6)

B<IMINACTIVE> (non inheritable): Image name of the element when
inactive. If it is not defined then the IMAGE is used and the colors
will be replaced by a modified version of the background color creating
the disabled effect. GTK will also change the inactive image to look
like other inactive objects. (GTK 2.6)

B<IMPRESS >(non inheritable): Image name of the pressed button. If
IMPRESS and IMAGE are defined, the button borders are not shown and not
computed in natural size. When the button is clicked the pressed image
does not offset. In Motif the button will lose its focus feedback also.
(GTK 2.6)

B<IMPRESSBORDER >(non inheritable): if enabled the button borders will
be shown and computed even if IMPRESS is defined. Can be "YES" or "NO".
Default: "NO".

B<IMAGEPOSITION >(non inheritable): Position of the image relative to
the text when both are displayed. Can be: LEFT, RIGHT, TOP, BOTTOM.
Default: LEFT. (since 3.0) (GTK 2.10)

B<MARKUP> [GTK only]: allows the title string to contains pango markup
commands. Works only if a mnemonic is NOT defined in the title. Can be
"YES" or "NO". Default: "NO".

B<PADDING>: internal margin. Works just like the MARGIN attribute of
the B<IupHbox> and B<IupVbox> containers, but uses a different name to
avoid inheritance problems. Default value: "0x0". (since 3.0)

B<SPACING >(creation only): defines the spacing between the image
associated and the button's text. Default: "2".

L<TITLE|../attrib/iup_title.html> (non inheritable): Button's text. If
IMAGE is not defined before map, then the default behavior is to
contain only a text. The button behavior can not be changed after map.
The natural size will be larger enough to include all the text in the
selected font, even using multiple lines, plus the button borders. The
'\n' character is accepted for line change. The "&" character can be
used to define a mnemonic, the next character will be used as key. Use
"&&" to show the "&" character instead on defining a mnemonic. The
button can be activated from any control in the dialog using the
"Alt+key" combination. In old Motif versions (2.1) using a '\n' causes
an invalid memory access inside Motif. (mnemonic support since 3.0)

=head2 Callbacks

L<ACTION|../call/iup_action.html>: Action generated when the button 1
(usually left) is selected. This callback is called only after the
mouse is released and when it is released inside the button area.

 int function(Ihandle* ih); [in C]elem:action() -> (ret: number) [in Lua]

B<ih>: identifier of the element that activated the event.

Returns: IUP_CLOSE will be processed.

L<BUTTON_CB|../call/iup_button_cb.html>: Action generated when any
mouse button is pressed and released.

All common callbacks are supported.

=head2 Notes

Buttons with images and/or texts can not change its behavior after
mapped. This is a creation dependency. But after creation the image can
be changed for another image, and the text for another text.

Buttons are activated using Enter or Space keys.

=head2 Examples

L<Browse for Example Files|../../examples/>

The buttons with image and text simultaneous have PADDING=5x5, the
other buttons have no padding. The buttons with no text and BGCOLOR
defined have their RASTERSIZE set.
