=head1 IupSbox

Creates a void container that allows its child to be resized. Allows
expanding and contracting the child B<size> in one direction.

It does not have a native representation but it contains also a
B<IupCanvas> to implement the bar handler.

=head2 Creation

 Ihandle* IupSbox(Ihandle* child); [in C]
 iup.sbox{child: ihandle} -> (elem: ihandle) [in Lua]
 sbox(child) [in LED]

B<child>: Identifier of an interface element which will receive the
box. It can be NULL (nil in Lua), not optional in LED.

Returns: the identifier of the created element, or NULL if an error
occurs.

=head2 Attributes

B<COLOR>: Changes the color of the bar handler. The value should be
given in "R G B" color style. Default: "192 192 192".

B<DIRECTION> (creation only): Indicates the direction of the resize and
the position of the bar handler. Possible values are "NORTH", "SOUTH"
(vertical direction), "EAST" or "WEST" (horizontal direction). Default:
"EAST".

L<EXPAND|../attrib/iup_expand.html> (non inheritable): It will expand
automatically only in the direction opposite to the handler.

B<WID> (read-only): returns -1 if mapped.

=head2 Notes

The controls that you want to be resized must have the EXPAND=YES
attribute set. The control inside the sbox will not be resized with a
size lesser than its B<Natural> size. See the L<Layout
Guide|../layout_guide.html> for mode details on sizes.

The B<IupCanvas> bar handler is always the first child of the sbox. It
can be obtained using B<IupGetChild> or B< IupGetNextChild>.

B<IupSbox> can make the layout to be resized larger than the dialog
size so some controls will be positioned outside the dialog area at
right or bottom. In fact this is part of the dynamic layout default
reposition of controls inside the dialog. See the B<IupRefresh>
function. The IUP layout does not have a maximum limit only a minimum,
except if you use the MAXSIZE common attribute.

The box can be created with no elements and be dynamic filled using
L<IupAppend|../func/iupappend.html> or
L<IupInsert|../func/iupinsert.html>.
