=head1 RESIZE_CB

Action generated when the element size is changed.

=head2 Callback

 int function(Ihandle *ih, int width, int height); [in C]
 elem:resize_cb(width, height: number) -> (ret: number) [in Lua]

B<ih>: identifier of the element that activated the event.

B<width>: the width of the internal element size in pixels not
considering the decorations (client size)

B<height>: the height of the internal element size in pixels not
considering the decorations (client size)

=head2 Notes

This action is also generated when the dialog is mapped, after the map
and before the show.

When XAUTOHIDE=Yes or YAUTOHIDE=Yes, if the canvas scrollbar is
hidden/shown after changing the DX or DY attributes from inside the
callback, the size of the drawing area will immediately change, so the
parameters B<with> and B<height> will be invalid. To update the
parameters consult the DRAWSIZE attribute. Also activate the drawing
toolkit only after updating the DX or DY attributes.
