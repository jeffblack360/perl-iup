=head1 Global Attributes

Global attributes are not associated with any particular element. They
represent and affect the global behavior of the toolkit.

To access global attributes use the
L<IupGetGlobal|../func/iupgetglobal.html> and
L<IupSetGlobal|../func/iupsetglobal.html> functions. In Lua global
attributes can only be accessed trough those functions. In C, the
functions L<IupGetAttribute|../func/iupgetattribute.html> and
L<IupSetAttribute|../func/iupsetattribute.html> can also be used if you
set the element handle to NULL.

----

=head2 X<General>General

=head2 B<X<LANGUAGE>LANGUAGE>

The language used by some pre-defined dialogs.

Can have the values ENGLISH and PORTUGUESE. Default: ENGLISH. Can also
be set by L<IupSetLanguage|../func/iupsetlanguage.html>.

=head2 B<X<version>VERSION> (read-only)

Returns the name of IUP's version.

The value follows the "major.minor.micro" format, major referring to
broader changes, minor referring to smaller changes, and micro
referring to corrections only. Ex.: "1.7.2".

=head2 X<copyright>B<COPYRIGHT> (read-only)

Returns the IUP's copyright.

Ex: "Copyright (C) 1994-2013 Tecgraf/PUC-Rio".

=head2 LASTERROR [Windows Only] (since 3.6)

If an error is found, returns a string with the system error
description.

=head2 IUPLUA_THREADED (since 3.6)

If defined allow IUP to be used inside coroutines in Lua.

=head2 X<driver>B<DRIVER> (read-only)

Informs the current driver being used.

Two drivers are available now, one for each platform: "GTK", "Motif"
and "Win32".

=head2 System X<Control>Control

=head2 B<LOCKLOOP>

When the last visible dialog is closed the B<IupExitLoop> function is
called. To avoid that set LOCKLOOP=YES before hiding the last dialog.
Possible values: "YES" or "NO". Default: "NO".

=head2 B<X<UTF8MODE>UTF8MODE> [Windows and GTK Only]

By default IUP uses strings in the current locale (See
L<FONT|iup_font.html#Encoding> attribute). To use UTF-8 strings set
this attribute to Yes. Default: NO.

=head2 B<UTF8MODE_FILE> [Windows Only]

By default IUP uses file names in the current locale, even when
UTF8MODE=Yes. To use UTF-8 file names set this attribute to Yes.
Default: NO.

=head2 SHOWMENUIMAGES [GTK Only] (since 3.5)

Force the display of images in menus. Default: Yes

=head2 GLOBALMENU [GTK Only] (since 3.6)

Flag indicating that GTK is using a global menu instead of a per window
menu. See more information at the L<GTK driver|../drv/gtk.html>
documentation.

=head2 B<SINGLEINSTANCE> [Windows Only] (since 3.2)

Restricts the number of instances of the application by using a name to
identify it. The value must also be a partial match to the title of a
dialog that will receive the COPYDATA_CB callback with the command line
of the second instance. When consulted returns NULL if inside the
second instance. So usually in the application initialization after
B<IupOpen>, set SINGLEINSTANCE and then consult its value, if NULL
abort the second instance by calling B< IupClose> and returning from
I<main>.

=head2 System X<Keyboard>Mouse and Keyboard

=head2 B<X<cursorpos>CURSORPOS>

Controls and returns the cursor position in absolute coordinates
relative to the upper left corner of the screen. Accept values in the
format "XB<x>Y" (in C "%dx%d), example "200x200". In GTK and Motif also
generates mouse motion messages. (since GTK 2.8)

=head2 B<X<MOUSEBUTTON>MOUSEBUTTON >(write-only) (since 3.3)

Simulates a mouse button press, release or motion at the given
coordinates. The position is in absolute coordinates relative to the
upper left corner of the screen. Accept values in the format "XB<x>Y
button state" (in C "%dx%d %c %d"), example "200x200 1 1". B<button>
can be one of the IUP_BUTTON1,... definitions. B< state> can be
2=double click, 1=pressed, 0=released, or -1=motion. The cursor
position is always updated. In Windows button can be 'W' and
state=delta, so a wheel button scroll is simulated.

B<IMPORTANT>: not fully working. In Windows and GTK, menu items are not
activated. Although submenus open, menu items even in the menu bar are
not activated. In Windows, inside the B< IupFileDlg> dialog, clicks in
the folder navigation list are not correctly interpreted. In Motif
click and drag operations are not performed.

=head2 B<KEYPRESS> (write-only) (since 3.0)

Sends a key press message to the element with the focus. The value is a
key code. See the L<Keyboard Codes|key.html> table for a list of the
possible values.

=head2 B<KEY>RELEASE (write-only) (since 3.0)

Sends a key release message to the element with the focus. The value is
a key code. See the L<Keyboard Codes|key.html> table for a list of the

=head2 B<X<AUTOREPEAT>AUTOREPEAT> [Motif Only]

Turns on/off ("YES" or "NO") the auto-repeat of keyboard keys in the
whole system. May be used as an optimization in high performance
applications.

=head2 X<INPUTCALLBACKS>INPUTCALLBACKS (since 3.4)

Turns on/off ("YES" or "NO") the global callbacks used to intercept
global mouse and keyboard events. The callbacks must be set using the
L<IupSetFunction|../func/iupsetfunction.html> function using the
following names:
B<GLOBAL>L<B<KEYPRESS_CB>|../call/iup_keypress_cb.html>,
B<GLOBAL>L<B<MOTION_CB>|../call/iup_motion_cb.html>,
B<GLOBAL>L<B<BUTTON_CB>|../call/iup_button_cb.html> and
B<GLOBAL>L<B<WHEEL_CB>|../call/iup_wheel_cb.html> (Windows Only). Their
parameters are the same as the standard callbacks, but without the
