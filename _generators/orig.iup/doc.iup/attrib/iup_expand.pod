=head1 EXPAND (non inheritable*)

Allows the element to expand, fulfilling empty spaces inside its
container.

It is a non inheritable attribute, but a container inherit its parents
EXPAND attribute. In other words, although EXPAND is non inheritable,
it is inheritable for containers. So if you set it at a container it
will not affect its children, except for those who are containers.

The expansion is done equally for all expandable elements in the same
container.

For a container, the actual EXPAND value will be always a
B<combination> of its own value and the value of its B<children>. In
the sense that a container can only expand if its children can expand
too in the same direction.

The HORIZONTALFREE and VERTICALFREE values will not behave as normal
expansion. These values will NOT affect the expansion of the container
when set at its children, the children will simply expand to the
available free space at the container. (Since 3.11)

See the L<Layout Guide|../layout_guide.html> for more details on sizes.
