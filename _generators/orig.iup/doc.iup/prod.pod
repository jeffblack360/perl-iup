=head1 X<visao_geral>Overview

IUP is a multi-platform toolkit for building graphical user interfaces.
It offers APIs in three basic languages: C, L<Lua|http://www.lua.org>
and LED.

Its library contains about 100 functions for creating and manipulating
dialogs.

IUP's purpose is to allow a program to run in different systems without
changes - the toolkit provides the application portability. Supported
systems include: GTK+, Motif and Windows.

IUP uses an abstract layout model based on the boxes-and-glue paradigm
from the TEX text editor. This model, combined with the
dialog-specification language (L<LED|sys_guide.html#led>) or with the
Lua binding (L<IupLua|sys_guide.html#iuplua>) makes the dialog creation
task more flexible and independent from the graphics system's
resolution.

Currently available interface elements can be categorized as follows:

=over

=item * B<Primitives> (effective user interaction): B<dialog, label,
button, text, multi-line, list, toggle, canvas, frame, image>.

=item * B<Composition> (ways to show the elements): B<hbox, vbox,>
B<zbox, fill>.

=item * B<Grouping> (definition of a common functionality for a group
of elements): B<radio>.

=item * B<Menu> (related both to menu bars and to pop-up menus):
B<menu, submenu, item, separator>.

=item * Additional (elements built outside the main library): B<dial,
gauge, matrix, tabs, valuator, OpenGL canvas, color chooser, color
browser>.

=item * B<Dialogs> (useful predefined dialogs): B<file selection,
message, alarm, data input, list selection>.

=back

Hence IUP has some advantages over other interface toolkits available:

=over

=item * B<Simplicity:> due to the small number of functions and to its
attribute mechanism, the learning curve for a new user is often faster.

=item * B<Portability:> the same functions are implemented in each one
of the platforms, thus assuring the interface system's portability.

=item * B<Customization:> the dialog specification language (LED) and
the Lua binding (IupLua) are two mechanisms in which it is possible to
customize an application for a specific user with a simple-syntax text
file.

=item * B<Flexibility>: its abstract layout mechanism provides
flexibility to dialog creation.

=item * B<Extensibility:> the programmer can create new interface
elements as needed.

=back

IUP is free software, can be used for public and commercial
applications.

=head1 X<disponibilidade>Availability

The library is available for several B<compilers>:

=over

=item * GCC and CC, in the UNIX environment

=item * Visual C++, Borland C++, Watcom C++ and GCC (Cygwin and MingW),
in the Windows environment

=back

The library is available for several B<operating systems>:

=over

=item * UNIX (SunOS, IRIX, and AIX) using Motif 2.x

=item * UNIX (FreeBSD and Linux) using GTK+ (since 3.0)

=head1 X<suporte>Support

The official support mechanism is by e-mail, using B<
L<iup@tecgraf.puc-rio.br|mailto:iup@tecgraf.puc-rio.br?subject=[IUP]>>.
Before sending your message:

=over

=item * Check if the reported behavior is not described in the user
guide.

=item * Check if the reported behavior is not described in the specific
control or driver characteristics.

=item * Check the History to see if your version is updated.

=item * Check the To Do list to see if your problem has already been
reported.

=back

If all these points were checked, you can report your problem. Please
specify in your message: B<function, attribute, callback, platform> and
B<compiler>.
