=head1 IupControls

=head2 Controls Library

Several additional controls are included in this library. These
controls are drawn by IUP using L<CD|http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/cd>
on a L<IupCanvas|elem/iupcanvas.html> control, and are not native
controls.

The B<iupcontrols.h> file must be included in the source code. If you
plan to use the control in Lua, you should also include
B<iupluacontrols.h>.

The B<IupControlsOpen> function must be called after B<IupOpen>. To
make the controls available in Lua use require"iupluacontrols" or
manually call the initialization function in C, B<iupcontrolslua_open>,
after calling B<iuplua_open>.

When manually calling the function your application must be linked to
the control library (B<iupcontrols>), the CD_IUP driver (B<iupcd>), and
with the L<CD|http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/cd> library (B<cd>). To use
its bindings to Lua, the program must also be linked to the
B<iupluacontrols> library.
