=head1 IupRefreshChildren (Since 3.3)

Updates the size and layout of controls after changing size attributes,
or attributes that affect the size of the control. Can be used for any
element inside a dialog, only its children will be updated. It can
change the layout of all the controls inside the given element because
of the dynamic layout positioning.

=head2 Parameters/Return

 void IupRefreshChildren(Ihandle *ih); [in C]
 iup.RefreshChildren(ih: ihandle) [in Lua]

B<ih>: identifier of the interface element.

=head2 Notes

The given element must be a container. It must be inside a dialog
hierarchy and must be mapped. It can not be a dialog. For dialogs use
B<IupRefresh>.

The children are immediately repositioned, if the dialog is visible
then the change will be immediately reflected on the display.

This function will NOT change the size of the given element, even if
the natural size of its children would increase its natural size.

If your dialog has too many controls and you want to hide or destroy
some, then add some other in the same place, so you actually know that
the dialog layout would not change, this is a much faster function than
B<IupRefresh>.
