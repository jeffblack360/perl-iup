=head1 IupSetFunction

Associates a function to an action as a global callback.

This function is now deprecated for regular elements, use it only
global callbacks. For regular elements use B<IupSetCallback> instead.

Notice that the application or libraries may set the same name for two
different functions by mistake. B<IupSetCallback> does not depends on
global names.

=head2 Parameters/Return

 Icallback IupSetFunction(const char *name, Icallback func); [in C]
 [There is no equivalent in Lua]

B<name>: name of an action.

B<func>: address of a C function. If NULL removes the association.

Returns: the address of the previous function associated to the action.
