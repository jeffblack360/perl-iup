=head1 IupLoad and IupLoadBuffer

Compiles a LED specification.

=head2 Parameters/Return

 char *IupLoad(const char *filename); [in C]
 iup.Load(filename: string) -> error: string [in Lua]
 
 char *IupLoadBuffer(const char *buffer); [in C] (since 3.0)
 iup.LoadBuffer(buffer: string) -> error: string [in Lua]

B<filename>: name of the file containing the LED specification.

B<buffer:> string with the LED specification.

Returns: NULL (nil in Lua) if the file was successfully compiled;
otherwise it returns a pointer to a string containing the error
message.

=head2 Notes

Each time the function loads a LED file, the elements contained in it
are created. Therefore, the same LED file cannot be loaded several
times, otherwise the elements will also be created several times (the
same applies for running Lua files several times).
