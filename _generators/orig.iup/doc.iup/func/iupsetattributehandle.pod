=head1 IupSetAttributeHandle

Instead of using B<IupSetHandle> and B<IupSetAttribute> with a new
creative name, this function automatically creates a non conflict name
and associates the name with the attribute.

It is very useful for associating images and menus.

=head2 Parameters/Return

 void IupSetAttributeHandle(Ihandle *ih, const char *name, Ihandle *ih_named); [in C]
 [There is no equivalent in Lua] 

B<ih>: identifier of the interface element.

B<name>: name of the attribute.

B<ih_named>: element to associate using a name

The function will not check for inheritance since all the attributes
that associate handles are not inheritable.

=head2 Notes

This work is automatically done in Lua when an attribute that is an
element name is set to an element handle. In other words, in Lua you
can set a string or a handle as the attribute value, when a handle is
used a name is automatically created just as the
B<IupSetAttributeHandle>.
