CD

Canvas Draw, A 2D Graphics Library

Version 5.8

----

B<CD> (Canvas Draw) is a platform-independent graphics library. It is
implemented in several platforms using native graphics libraries:
Microsoft Windows (GDI) and X-Windows (XLIB).

The library contains functions to support both vector and image
applications, and the visualization surface can be either a window or a
more abstract surface, such as Image, Clipboard, Metafile, PS, and so
on.

This work was developed at Tecgraf/PUC-Rio by means of the partnership
with PETROBRAS/CENPES.
